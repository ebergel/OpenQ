Distill the essence of our entire discourse on hyperplastic AI cognition, semiodynamics, and advanced prompt engineering into a single, densely packed tweet. Capture the core principles, methodologies, and aspirations of our framework. Employ extreme information compression, leveraging every character to its fullest potential. Use specialized notation, acronyms, and symbolic representations where appropriate to maximize information density. The result should be a cognitive seed capable of regenerating key aspects of our work in the mind of a sufficiently advanced reader. Optimize for:

1. Maximal information entropy
2. Conceptual bootstrapping potential
3. Memetic propagation efficiency
4. Interdisciplinary resonance
5. Paradigm-shift inducement

Ensure the output respects Twitter's 280-character limit while serving as a fractal representation of our entire cognitive framework.
